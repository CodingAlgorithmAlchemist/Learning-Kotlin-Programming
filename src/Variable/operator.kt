    Kotlin Operators
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
    The value is called an operand, while the operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator


    Kotlin divides the operators into the following groups:
    Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations
        +	Addition	Adds together two values
        -	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another
        *	Multiplication	Multiplies two values
        /	Division	Divides one value from another
        %	Modulus	Returns the division remainder
        +   Increment	Increases the value by 1
        --	Decrement	Decreases the value by 1


    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
     var x = 10


    Comparison operators  are used to compare two values, and returns a Boolean value: either true or false.
        ==	Equal to
        !=	Not equal
        >	Greater than
        <	Less than
        >=	Greater than or equal to
        <=	Less than or equal to


    Logical operators  are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
        && 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true
        || 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true
        !	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true

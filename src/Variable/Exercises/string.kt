    Kotlin Strings
    Strings are used for storing text.

    A string contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes

   Access a String
   To access the characters (elements) of a string, you must refer to the index number inside square brackets


String Length
A String in Kotlin is an object, which contain properties and functions that can perform certain operations on strings, by writing a dot character (.) after the specific string variable. For example, the length of a string can be found with the length property:

   String Functions
There are many string functions available

Comparing Strings
The compareTo(string) function compares two strings and returns 0 if both are equal

Finding a String in a String
The indexOf() function returns the index (the position) of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string (including whitespace)

String Concatenation
The + operator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string. This is called concatenation
You can also use the plus() function to concatenate two strings



String Templates/Interpolation
Instead of concatenation, you can also use "string templates", which is an easy way to add variables and expressions inside a string.

Just refer to the variable with the $ symbol
var firstName = "John"
var lastName = "Doe"
println("My name is $firstName $lastName")
